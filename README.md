## üíª Project

AgileDex is an Android application that allows users to explore the world of Pok√©mon. The app
retrieves data from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) and provides a paginated list of Pok√©mon with
their basic details. Users can browse, filter, and check more detailed information about each
Pok√©mon, including an image and various attributes.
